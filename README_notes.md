# Notes
- use strict -> forces you to declare variables (helps reduce bugs in the program, always use this)
- use warnings -> more verbose (see problems like uninitialized variables and such)
- brackets are optional on function declaration "sub main{} equals sub main(){}"
- string arguments inside single quotes are interpreted as literal strings, while double quotes special characters will get interpreted

## VS Code
- Install Perl Navigator (auto complete on dependencies) and Perl Toolbox (linting and syntax check)
